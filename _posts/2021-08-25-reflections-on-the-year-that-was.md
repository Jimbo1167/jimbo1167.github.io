# <a href="{{ page.url }}"> Reflections on the year that was 2020</a>

This post is long overdue.  The past year has been one of the most consequential years of my lifetime, and it's about time to sit down and discuss it. Let's dig in.

2020 was a year filled with fear, pain, sadness, little joy, anguish, uncertainty, exhaustion, and confusion.  You'll see little moments in here where some joy slipped through, but mainly the year was filled with negative emotions.  Unsurprisingly my goals took a break from me in 2020, as we'll get into, but I'm not upset by that. When I look back at it all, I can simply say: 2020 happened.

Getting a hold on what happened seems easy enough, but peek under the curtains, and there was a lot more going on than meets the surface.  2020 was the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted the lives of people across the globe. It was the year of social justice across the US. It was the year where democracy felt like it was crumbling. It was the year I became a father.  It all feels like a strange dream now that we're on the other side of it, but I'm jumping ahead already.

The week prior to the pandemic feeling real, I had my team in from out of town.  My new team had just formed recently, and we had our first official meeting of everyone in Atlanta in March of 2020.  We had coworkers in from San Francisco and Toronto, and it felt like a meeting of the minds since we were able to iterate on some pretty cool initiatives. We set our sights on goals for the year and planned out some milestones to achieve those goals, but who would have thought that a week later, all of our lives would drastically change.

My work was one of the few who went virtual fairly early on March 10th, when we announced we would be going entirely virtual starting on the 11th â€“ we've been like that ever since.  I remember staying home that Monday since we had an exhaustingly long week with everyone in town; little did I know that my last experience in the office would be with coworkers from San Francisco and Toronto.

That marked a key point for me, but it really hit home once more places started closing, including the NBA on March 11th.  From then on, we were in uncharted territory. We had to adapt along the way to figure out how to interview completely remotely, socialize, and continue operating the business.

I'll take a quick break from the doom and gloom to interject that it was at this point in the year that my wife and I found out she was pregnant with our first child! We were thrilled but also a little terrified since we had just found out COVID-19 was spreading fast across the US, but we had plenty of time to fix that damn pandemic before our son was due, or so we thought...

2020 wasn't all about the pandemic; 2020 was also the year a large portion of the US and across the world realized how systemic racism is baked into institutions we rely on, like policing and government.  This was in part due to the passing of George Floyd in a gruesome 10-minute video where officers showed no regard for his life and led to protests across the world.  It marked a moment in time that I hope we will not soon forget, as we seem to have in the past.  This blatant racism was nothing new for the black community; they'll explain this has been happening since the dawn of the nation; the only difference is it's captured on video now.

These moments were yet another reason I felt distracted and absent from my work.  How could I put in perspective the work I was doing when my coworkers lived a completely different experience based on their skin color? When I saw protestors use their constitutional right to protest but ultimately be pushed back with tear gas and be called looters and thugs filled my heart with pain and sadness, and to say I was distracted was truly putting it mildly.

I also was coping with the fact that my son would soon be brought into this world, a world that seemed to be spinning out of control, and I would have to be there to give him answers on why the world is the way it is. Damn. I did not feel prepared for this.

At this point, we're in the summer, and things are still not looking great for any resuming of everyday life.  It was clear we would have to hold out until we either reached herd immunity or developed vaccines. Still, everything we heard was a vaccine was not a guarantee, especially since we haven't developed a vaccine for a Coronavirus before.

In the US, we also had to deal with an out-of-control president who spouted nonsense at his daily press briefings about the virus and his administration's response to the virus.  These meandering press conferences only made the fear and uncertainty worse, and worse yet, we had an election to deal with in November.  This was shaping up to be one of the most tumultuous times in US history, and it was playing out in front of my very own eyes.

Throw in the anxiety about my pregnant wife getting the virus and knowing pregnant women had an increased risk of hospitalization and death.  Laura and I were extremely careful the entire year not to socialize with anyone outside of our bubble. Anytime we did have someone visit, we insisted on them receiving a negative COVID-19 test.  I can honestly say there were moments in 2020 where I felt utterly adrift, we had all of these looming threats, and I felt powerless to stop any of them.

As a man, that's a very interesting feeling. Being a male in a heterosexual relationship, I'm assuming the role of protector and stability in the household, but I couldn't offer either at this time.  I felt like I was on an island with my wife scrounging for supplies, and I hadn't had the faintest idea of how to build a fire or get us off this island.

Thankfully we made it through the fall without a hitch, though the election was right around the corner, and then so was our son.  Not to mention everyone said we wouldn't really know the winner of the election until maybe a week after election night due to all of the mail-in ballots that were expected (we were in the midst of a pandemic after all).

The stretch between the election and my son's birth was indeed some of the most frightening. It felt like democracy was in the balance, as our President had alluded to not leaving after a second term.  He came off as a fully-fledged crazy person who had contracted COVID-19 but claimed COVID itself wasn't that bad (well, hello, you had the best doctors in the world to help your sorry ass).

Oh, and the "pandemic 15" that everyone was talking about definitely turned into 25 pounds of stress eating and sympathy weight gain from the pregnancy; we'll focus on that in 2021 :).

We got through the election, which was as stressful of an election that I've ever been through, and thankfully it felt like we were getting some stability in the White House when Joe Biden was confirmed as the president-elect. This election was also historical as we would have our first female black and south-Asian Vice President in Kamala Harris.  It felt like things were on the up and up for a change (we'll get into how fleeting that was if I decide to talk about the start of 2021...).

A few weeks after Joe Biden was confirmed president-elect, we welcomed our son into the world, Andrew James Schindler. Andrew's arrival was an exciting new chapter that opened for us. We had something new to pour all of our time and love into and couldn't have come at a better time during the year.

Andrew's arrival was something impossible to put into words.  The uniqueness of being born during a pandemic will not even register in his mind, but it was bizarre for the two of us, to say the least.  From not being able to have friends or family visit us after he was born in the hospital to being shocked at the actual faces of our nurses after we saw one of them on Facebook ("she really looks like that?" we said to ourselves). The protocols inside the maternity ward were also fairly strict and required us to stay in place after we checked in, meaning if we forgot anything at home, we were SOL.

After bringing Andrew home, it felt like no time before we had holiday breaks in front of us, and eventually, we rang in the new year as a new family of three.  Andrew's early weeks were similar to any baby, lots of waking up in the middle of the night, right next to our bed in his bassinet, where Laura would wake up and breastfeed him and put him back to sleep.  It seems like so long ago as I write this, but it was less than nine months ago, which is truly staggering.

Wrapping this up, 2020 was one for the books, and I'm only scratching the surface of it all.  I hardly touched on the isolation, the doom and gloom on the internet/TV all day, and the impending sense of doom that we all felt throughout the year.  On the other side, it feels reassuring that if we can get through these tough times, the joyful times will be much better.
