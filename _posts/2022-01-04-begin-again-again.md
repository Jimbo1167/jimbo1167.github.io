# <a href="{{ page.url }}"> Begin again, again</a>

Another year down and another time to reflect on what happened in the last twelve months.  This year felt like it was going to be a reset from 2020, but in the end, it turns out we're back, thinking 2022 is everything 2021 promised us.  Time to dig into everything we got into in 2021, good, bad, or otherwise.  Let's begin again, again...

<!--more-->

I've already mentioned this, but 2021 felt like a rebirth of sorts.  2020 was the year we started the pandemic, and after vaccines began rolling out in 2021, it felt like we were at a clear ending to everything, but it turns out we were just in another phase of the pandemic.  We felt like we had a solid two weeks of "hot vax summer" between May and June until we encountered the first variant of genuine concern, the Delta Variant.

At some time, we were told the virus was going to mutate to both avoid the protections of the vaccine but potentially get more infectious and undetermined on the severity of infection.  The Delta variant was the first time we had exactly that presented to us all.  The strength of the vaccine against this variant was not 100%, and further complicating things was the fact that children like Andrew still had no protection against COVID.

This put a stall to everything getting back to normal, though much of the economy started to get back into the swing of things â€“ full stadiums for College Football, Basketball, Baseball, etc.  This was exciting to see in contrast to what we experienced back in 2020.  Also exciting was seeing my Milwaukee Bucks win the NBA Championship for the first time since 1971.

Post-summer is when I think I started getting a little off the rails with both my diet, my mental health, and my goals overall.  This was a challenging time as Laura began her final class in her Master's Degree in Computer Science; this time, it was in a Machine Learning class which monopolized her time and made me the bearer of child-rearing activities for Andrew in the morning, nights, and weekends.

We knew this was going to be a short-term thing (though on reflection, a whole semester certainly doesn't feel short), and it was the finale to Laura reaching her dream of having a Master's Degree.  These all were understandable sacrifices, but I came out of this experience with even more understanding about myself, my shortcomings, and us as a family overall.

I discovered that under times of extreme stress and fatigue, the discipline to have a well-balanced diet goes out the window.  In retrospect, this makes sense, and I don't mean to crank up the excuse machine *excuse machine gets cranking*, but it makes sense â€“ I used all of my free time watching Andrew, dropping him off and picking him up from daycare, watching him afterward, and using my weekends to watch him too.  This left me exhausted and not wanting to cook anything during or toward the end of the day, so ordering food was the default, which wasn't always the healthy option.

Short break â€“ I have **immense** respect for any single parent out there who is working overtime to do this gig solo â€“ it is no joke, and these parents deserve our understanding and respect for what they do to provide for their children.

Ok, so maybe I had some resources at my hand as well to make this a little easier, in the form of our in-laws and Laura's friends who told us they were happy to watch Andrew from time to time, but this leads to the next big thing I realized about myself.  I'm very reluctant to ask for help, and you'll see this pop up in my goals for this year on something I really want to work towards this year.  In the past, I could rely on Laura if I was truly out of commission and needed a break, but with her school taking so much of her time, I had to branch out and ask our friends and family for support, but for whatever reason, this did not come naturally to me.  Call it pride and shyness if you like; I really don't have a great excuse other than I didn't want to feel like I was abandoning Andrew or causing undue stress and obligation to our friends and family.

I need to stop this thinking cycle and accept the help when it is both offered or even when it isn't; suffering in silence is one way to have a stress breakdown, which ironically enough didn't happen until Laura was nearing her final week in class.

So, now that the excuse machine is in full dispensing mode, what did this do to my goals for 2021?  Let's take a look:

Focusing on losing the Pandemic 15/25?  Well, that got worse, unfortunately.  The stress eating pushed me towards the top of the scale and refocused my attention on getting that weight back down to where I wanted it.

Reading 52 books? *Well fun story there...* I did read 52 books...but I had to include the children's books I read to Andrew throughout the year ðŸ˜….

So what are my goals for 2022?

### Goals for 2022

+ Lose weight to get back in 185-195 lb range
+ Read 52 books, full-stop - children books not included this time
+ Start talking to a therapist regularly to work on my mental health and accept help from others
+ Keep up with Andrew's growing needs and anticipate changes to his schedule, food needs, and engaging activities.
+ Take Andrew out to Wisconsin!
+ Invest in my hobbies I've picked up lately, like Poker.
+ Talk at a tech conference or meetup

I'm not going to elaborate on much of those, as they are pretty self-explanatory, other than the therapist goal.  This stems from the stress breakdown during the end of November/early December.  This was the time the things I was pushing down finally bubbled up to the surface, I needed to vent, and Laura was the unfortunate target for all of the things I felt because I hadn't talked about them openly enough.  I want to improve the communication of my feelings and deal with that inner voice that constantly wants to beat me up for needing help or not meeting my goals.  I have that monkey on my back criticizing me when I fail my goals and aspirations, and I'd like to replace that with some good ole fashioned self-love and self-care along the way, and I don't want to rely on Laura to be that person for me all the time.  The first reason is some of these things aren't really great to throw on her lawn, so to speak.  I want to take the journey to get my house in order without having to put that on my loved ones, and therapy seems like a great way to straighten these things out.  I also want to remove the negative stigma of therapy for both myself and others because it really isn't a weakness; it's a commitment to bettering myself as best I can.  2020 and 2021 have taught me the most is how mental health plays such a vital role in everything we do.  We can be paralyzed at work, at home, or at school if we have these mental barriers or that inner voice beating ourselves up constantly, which can tear down all of the motivation and discipline we tried to build up.  I figure, what a time to build a relationship with a therapist and have that resource than the present â€“ that way, when I'm truly at my wit's end, I have a built-in outlet to help me through it.

Well thats it, I hope to also write in this blog more as well, but I want to focus on the goals outlined here first and foremost.

Jim
