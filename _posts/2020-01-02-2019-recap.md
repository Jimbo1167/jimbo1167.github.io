# <a href="{{ page.url }}"> 2019 In Review</a>
Well, my blog writing goal of 2019 fizzled and died with a grand total of **one** post for 2019.  Let's change that with 2020, and to start, I'll recap one of the most impactful years of my life.

2019 was, without a doubt, the most change that I've encountered in my life so far.  To blast through the changes, with more details in the coming paragraphs, we: got a new dog, sold our condo, moved into a new house, changed jobs/careers (new job for me after ~6 years, entirely new career for my wife, Laura), and went through a pretty trying time while my father-in-law recovered from sepsis due to a recent back surgery.

I also set out to lose some weight in 2019 after coming back from the holidays and weighing more than I've ever weighed before.  I decided on a radical change - I would try out a diet change that led me to lose 60 pounds and get in the best shape of my life as a result.

The diet I decided on was the Keto diet, and I spent plenty of time at the beginning of the year reading good books like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1820055.Good_Calories_Bad_Calories">Good Calories, Bad Calories</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29874881-the-case-against-sugar">The Case Against Sugar</a>.  This reinforced my diet choice and led me to hit my goal weight by the middle of the year.

The change in diet was definitely meaningful, but I also upped my activity level, thanks in part to our new dog, Sadie.

Saide is a mixed breed small dog we rescued from the Fulton County Animal shelter.  She weighs 20 pounds and seems to be thankful to be in our new house! She was found abandoned after having given birth to a litter of puppies.  She was still actively lactating when she was found, and unfortunately, they had no idea where her pups were :(.

Sadie was a bit of a handful when we were still living in the condo, and is much happier now that she has a fenced-in backyard to run around in.  

Speaking of the new house, that was another big moment of our year, when we closed on a new house at the end of August.  Our journey to own a new place that fit the needs of both of us felt like a long time coming, and this was the year that we finally made the switch.  Our new house is in the Lindridge Martin Manor neighborhood and is the perfect blend of needs from the two of us.

I required still being inside the city of Atlanta, while Laura needed a bigger kitchen, a fenced-in outdoor area, and a double vanity! Thankfully we got that and a bonus "man cave" downstairs where we can have peaceful solo time in the house.

Here's a quick glimpse from the backyard of our new house

Homeownership is new for the both of us, and we both miss parts of the #condolife, but it's safe to say we're enjoying the benefits of more space and comfort that the house brought us.

Right before we signed the contract for the new house, we actually had significant developments in our careers.  For Laura, she made the career transition to becoming a Software Engineer! She now works for a healthcare startup in Midtown Atlanta that is focusing on cardiac and metabolic disorders, specifically helping with the patient and provider interaction to help manage and monitor the patient's health.

Her new job is an excellent blend of past experience and is a great warm introduction to software engineering.  I'm excited to see her continue to grow in her role and expand her engineering knowledge :).

For me, I decided to leave my previous employer after nearly 6 years there.  My decision was not an easy one, as the people and products I had worked on were near and dear to my heart.  Ultimately I felt the push to continue to adapt and evolve to be an overwhelming force, and what better way than to join a much larger organization in PagerDuty.

I decided to take a role as an Engineering Manager and have not looked back since.  So far, it has been a whirlwind of positive change in my life.  I've adapted to a distributed workforce, a remote manager, and changes that feel like come at the speed of light.

The change has been great, and I'm glad we both are continuing to learn and grow in our careers.

The last big moment happens to be a bit of a long story, and a bit difficult to explain the gravity of.  Early in 2019, my father-in-law had back surgery to relieve him of chronic pain he had been having.  As a surgeon, the years bending over and performing his duties took its toll, and eventually, the doctor became the patient.

I was a bit naive about the potential drawbacks to surgery, but the sober reality kicked in when we were told he had a post-operation infection.  What I thought was a quick trip to the hospital quickly turned into much worse.  His previous surgery had led to a full-blown infection in his bones and flesh around the wound.

His infection was so bad that the hospital he was staying at was not suited to treat him for his infection â€“ he would require emergency evacuation via helicopter.  We felt so helpless in the hospital as we saw him intubated and flown away.  We were beside ourselves as we raced to the hospital through Atlanta traffic, not knowing if he made it to the hospital and to the operating room in time.

The whole episode was a moment of prayer and reflection for the family, and we were relieved to hear hours later from the doctor that he was stable from the clean-out of his surgery site and a heavy dose of antibiotics.  He would spend the next couple months in and out of the hospital, and is still on the path to recovery, though with limited mobility on the horizon.

This has made us thankful that he's still with us today, and also aware of how fragile life can be.  It gave me thanks for my health and family, as we were there for each other during a difficult time.

I am hoping for continued good health for myself and the rest of the family, and hoping my father-in-law will be able to adjust to his new reality of retirement and mobility.  Going through this process has made it very clear to continue to take care of myself through diet and exercise, as health is something you can easily take for granted until it is too late.

I'll be writing another blog post outlining some of my ambitious goals for 2020, which **will** happen in the next month :).

Jim
