# Dev Nexus 2019 - It's Here!

It has been a full year since the last DevNexus, and a lot has certainly changed since last year.

On the track front, it certainly is nice to see a whole track dedicated to Grails/Groovy/Micronaut.  In years past there have been a couple of brief talks, but nothing like this year.

I'm most excited about trying out Micronaut for a couple side projects, as I think the lightweight nature of the framework makes it really nice for prototyping out features.

DevNexus is always a good time to reflect on review what I want to learn professionally as well as set the stage for what to look out for in the future.  The quality of speakers is sometimes hit or miss, but overall I think it's a can't miss conference for anyone living in the Atlanta area.

Personally my goals for the year are similar to last year, read books, learn a new language, and become a better developer and manager. I've already started at a good pace for 2019, you can see my full list here:

There's been a lot of different books thus far, mostly for personal reading, but coming out of DevNexus I usually get a handful of techincal books to add to the reading list.
